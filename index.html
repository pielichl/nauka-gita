                <br><br><b>We</b> walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>
                And in spring too I feel no different.<br>
                We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>
                through much dark-red loss, <span class="italic">appellation control√©e,</span><br>

            <span class="chapter2">
                <br><i>that deepens in the cellar of the years.</i><br>
                We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>
                Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>
                sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br>
            </span>

            <span class="chapter3">
                <br>33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>
                of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>
                at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br>
            </span>

            <span class="chapter4">
                <br>Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>
                The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>
                The here is nowhere, and the now is never.<br>
